# PM2.5_Prediction_TimeSeries

## Introduction 
While Chinaâ€™s economy and population have grown dramatically in the past three decades, air pollution has become a serious issue. Of the twenty cities with the worst air pollution worldwide, sixteen are located in China. Beijing, the capital of China, suffers most from air pollution.

In this project, the aim is to utilize time series forecasting to predict the levels of PM 2.5 in Beijing. 
Accurate and accessible air pollution forecasts can raise public awareness, allow for sensitive populations to plan ahead, and provide governments with information for public health alerts.
